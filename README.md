The captions for an image is generated using a pretrained model taken from hugging face which provides many pretrained models that are used for NLP tasks.
On considering this model in generating the captions, images are converted into bgr so that model can predict and generate caption precisely.
Those captions are generated based on extracted features and generation parameters
